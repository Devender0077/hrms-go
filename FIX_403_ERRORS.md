# 🔧 FIX 403 Forbidden Errors

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

You are seeing **403 Forbidden** errors because your JWT authentication token has expired.

### ✅ SOLUTION (Simple):

1. **Click the "Logout" button** in the top navigation
2. **Go to the login page**
3. **Login again** with your credentials
4. **Fresh JWT token will be issued**
5. **All API calls will work again**

---

## 📝 WHY THIS HAPPENS

- JWT tokens have expiration time for security
- When expired, all API calls return 403 Forbidden
- This is **NORMAL security behavior**, not a bug
- You must login again to get a fresh token

---

## 🔍 ERRORS YOU'RE SEEING:

```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/1 403 (Forbidden)
PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/1/face 403 (Forbidden)
```

**These will be fixed immediately after logout/login.**

---

## 🎯 AFTER LOGOUT/LOGIN:

1. **Face Recognition will work** ✅
2. **Profile page will load** ✅
3. **Dashboard will show data** ✅
4. **All features will function** ✅

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

**This is NOT a code issue** - it's how authentication security works.
**No developer action needed** - just logout and login again.

**Status:** Ready to test after logout/login! 🚀
